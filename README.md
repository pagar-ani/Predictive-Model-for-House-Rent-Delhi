# Delhi Rental Price Prediction Modelling

## Overview

This project, undertaken as an academic endeavor, focuses on engineering a predictive model for rental prices in Delhi. It reflects a strong passion for leveraging data, technology, and analytical research skills to derive insights from complex datasets. The work demonstrates an ability to take initiative in managing data-centric projects and applying learnings from academic experiences and a comprehensive Data Analytics certification to uncover market trends.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to understand the key market factors that influence residential rental prices in Delhi and to develop a predictive model capable of estimating these prices. This addresses the common challenge of navigating a dynamic and often opaque rental market.

## Dataset

*   **Source:** The dataset used for this project was obtained from **Kaggle**. It is a publicly available dataset originally compiled by a third-party provider.
*   **Collection Method:** The original data provider **scraped housing information from Makaan.com**, a prominent Indian real estate portal. This scraped data, focusing on rental properties in Delhi and including various market factors, was subsequently made available on Kaggle. For this project, the pre-compiled Kaggle dataset was utilized for analysis.

## Methodology

The project followed a structured approach to model development:

*   **Data Collection:** Initial efforts focused on utilizing the pre-compiled dataset sourced from Kaggle, which originated from web scraping Makaan.com.
*   **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Python, along with its associated data science libraries, was utilized for comprehensive data cleaning processes. This stage also involved in-depth data analysis to understand underlying patterns, relationships between variables, and to prepare the data for modelling.
*   **Predictive Modelling:** A predictive model was built using Python to forecast rental prices. This process aimed at identifying significant predictors and uncovering trends within the Delhi rental market based on the analyzed data.

## Key Findings & Deliverables

The project culminated in several key outcomes:
*   Identification of discernible trends and influential factors within the Delhi rental market.
*   Development of a functional predictive model for estimating rental prices.
*   Compilation of all findings, methodologies, and analyses into a structured, comprehensive report.
*   Creation of effective data visualizations to clearly communicate the derived insights and model performance.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were instrumental in the completion of this project:

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Key Libraries/Tools:**
    *   **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical analysis.
    *   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For developing visualizations and exploratory data analysis.
    *   **Scikit-learn:** As a standard Python library for building predictive models (machine learning).
