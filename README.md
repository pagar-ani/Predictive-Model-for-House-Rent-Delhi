# Project: Delhi Rental Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project represents a practical application of data science principles to engineer a predictive model for residential rental prices in Delhi. It was undertaken to demonstrate skills in data analysis, technological implementation, and methodical research to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. The work showcases project management capabilities and the application of knowledge from academic coursework and a Data Analytics certification to identify and understand market dynamics.

## Problem Statement

The core objective was to dissect the key market factors influencing rental prices within Delhi and to construct a reliable predictive model for price estimation. This addresses the common challenge of navigating an often opaque and rapidly changing rental market, providing a data-driven approach to price assessment.

## Dataset

*   **Source:** The dataset utilized was sourced from Kaggle, originating from a third-party compilation.
*   **Origin:** Data was initially gathered by scraping housing information from Makaan.com, a significant Indian real estate portal. This scraped data, focused on Delhi rental properties and their associated market factors, formed the basis of the Kaggle dataset used for this analysis.

## Methodology

A structured, systematic approach was employed for model development:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Utilized the pre-compiled Kaggle dataset, originally sourced from Makaan.com web scraping.
2.  **Data Preprocessing & Analysis:** Employed Python and its associated data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy) for thorough data cleaning, validation, and in-depth exploratory analysis. This phase focused on identifying patterns, variable relationships, and preparing the data for robust modeling.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a predictive model using Python (Scikit-learn) to forecast rental prices. The process emphasized identifying significant predictors and understanding underlying trends within the Delhi rental market based on the empirical data.

## Key Findings & Deliverables

The project resulted in the following concrete outcomes:

*   Identification of significant trends and influential factors driving rental prices in the Delhi market.
*   Development of a functional predictive model capable of estimating rental prices based on property attributes.
*   A comprehensive report detailing methodologies, analyses, findings, and model performance.
*   Creation of clear data visualizations (using Matplotlib and Seaborn) to communicate insights and model results effectively.

## Technologies Utilized

The following tools and technologies were instrumental to the project's execution:

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical operations.
    *   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
    *   **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating predictive machine learning models.
